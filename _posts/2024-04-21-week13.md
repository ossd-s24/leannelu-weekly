## The Cathedral and the Bazaar Discussion

My favorite lesson from *The Cathedral and the Bazaar* was, "To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you." I found that it spoke the most to me personally, as I work the best when I'm actively interested in something, but I tend to forget that and try to force myself to work on things that I seem like I should be working on instead.

In this class for instance, when picking open source projects to work on for our group projects, I initially felt like I should choose something that seemed more technical or impressive, but as we filled out our preferences I realized I should instead work on something that actually interested me, which ended up being the right decision as I was much more motivated to work on something related to my interest in game design than I would've been to work on something else, even if it would've been more "impressive."

The discussion in class around good programmers knowing what to rewrite and reuse was really enlightening for me, as I hadn't thought about rewriting code as so important, but after hearing others in class talk about their experiences rewriting or not rewriting code and the problems they ran into from rewriting too much or not knowing what to rewrite made this quote speak to me more.

## Group Progress

Our group is continuing to make progress on our contributions to Godot. I have finally made my pull request for the benchmark I wrote, having asked the maintainers some questions about how it should be written and made some changes accordingly, as well as refactoring the code to align with Godot's style guide. Now I am aiming to work on an open source game that uses Godot and is listed on their plugins list, as it is a recent project and seems fairly active, with many areas that can be added to or improved. I am also aiming to work more with other members of my group to actually contribute to this game, since so far we've mainly been working individually on separate areas of Godot, and I think we could get more done working together on one area.

In terms of challenges, we have still had little luck contributing to the main repo of Godot, as we branch out into demos, benchmarks, and plugins. I've been continuing to check the issues of the main repo to see if there is anything I can contribute to on that front, but I think my own challenge is just overcoming the feeling of not contributing to the core engine itself as being a failure; we are still making contributions to other areas of Godot and projects related to Godot, and I should still think of those as successful contributions to Godot as a whole. Working on demos, plugins, and benchmarks that use Godot also help me become more familiar with using the engine rather than just the code behind the engine, which in the long run will help me more personally, as I'd like to be able to use Godot to make my own games in the future.
