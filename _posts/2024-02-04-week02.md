title: "Week 2: Codes of Conduct"
---

I definitely consider a Code of Conduct to be an important part of open source projects, to set guidelines for how the community should act and prevent harrassment and disrespect. A Code of Conduct also sets the tone for new contributors to understand what the community will be like and how it functions. Even if community members don't read the Code of Conduct, it still is reassuring to have rules to point to if anyone violates them. I wouldn't want to work on a project that didn't have a Code of Conduct, because I would be uncertain of how welcoming the community would be, and I would feel like I had no protection against any sort of harrassment. I'd be too afraid to participate in the community without any guarantee that it had my interests at heart.

It seems difficult to actually enforce Code of Conduct rules, even if there is a contact listed to reach out to for reporting violations, because especially in large communities the majority of Code of Conduct violations would likely fall under the radar. If a community has dedicated moderators, enforcement might be easier, but that might still be unrealistic in large communities where there are too many interactions to keep track of. Enforcement of the Code of Conduct seems to fall onto the community a lot of the time, to keep an eye out and remind each other of its standards.
