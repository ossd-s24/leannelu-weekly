title: "Week 3: Git and Browser Extension"
---

## Git

I have some basic familiarity with Git, and I've used it for class assignments and one or two personal and collaborative projects, but I tend to not be very confident when using it, so this week's in-class Git activity was helpful for building my confidence with it. It was good to have a step-by-step breakdown of using Git, including forking, cloning, staging, and merging, and to do it in a low stakes way without fear of messing something up in an important repository. There was a bit of confusion during the in-class exercise with unexpected merge conflicts, but that also ended up feeling helpful to learn how to work around it.

## Browser Extension

It's been interesting so far to work with my group on our first browser extension. We ran into a problem where we weren't sure how to split up the work of coding it, since all the logic felt like it would be connected and we didn't want to trample over each other's work. We elected to try to keep the extension simple since none of us have made a browser extension before, and we got into a good rhythm of making different branches and creating pull requests to try to prevent conflicts. I'm also not very familiar with JavaScript, so so far most of my contributions have been focused on making sure the project is properly open source, by adding documentation like a Code of Conduct and a contributing file.
